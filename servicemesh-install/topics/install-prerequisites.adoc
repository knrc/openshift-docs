= {ProductName} installation prerequisites

Before you can install {ProductName}, you must meet the following prerequisites:

* Possess an active {product-title} subscription on your Red Hat account. If you do not have a subscription, contact your sales representative for more information.
* Install {product-title} version 3.11, or higher.   For more information about the system and environment requirements, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html/installing_clusters/install-config-install-prerequisites#system-requirements[OpenShift Container Platform documentation].
* Install the version of the {product-title} command line utility (the `oc` client tool) that matches your {product-title} version and add it to your path. For example, if you have {product-title} 3.11 you must have the matching `oc` client version 3.11. For installation instructions, see the {product-title} https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/cli_reference/#installing-the-cli[Command Line Reference] document.


[[preparing-openshift-installation]]
== Preparing the {product-title} installation

Before you can install the {ProductShortName} into an {product-title} installation, you must modify the master configuration and each of the schedulable nodes. These changes enable the features that are required in the {ProductShortName} and also ensure that Elasticsearch features function correctly.

[[updating-master-configuration]]
== Updating the master configuration

[NOTE]
====
The community version of Istio will inject the sidecar by default if you have labeled the namespace.  You are not required to label the namespace with {ProductName}. However, {ProductName} requires you to opt-in to having the sidecar automatically injected to a deployment.  This is to avoid injecting a sidecar where it is not wanted (for example build or deploy pods).
====

To enable the automatic injection of the {ProductShortName} sidecar you must first modify the master configuration on each master to include support for webhooks and signing of Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs).

Make the following changes on each master within your {product-title} 3.11 installation:

. Change to the directory containing the master configuration file (for example, /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml).
. Create a file named `master-config.patch` with the following contents:
+
```
admissionConfig:
  pluginConfig:
    MutatingAdmissionWebhook:
      configuration:
        apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
        kubeConfigFile: /dev/null
        kind: WebhookAdmission
    ValidatingAdmissionWebhook:
      configuration:
        apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
        kubeConfigFile: /dev/null
        kind: WebhookAdmission
```
+
. In the same directory, issue the following commands to apply the patch to the `master-config.yaml` file:
+
```
$ cp -p master-config.yaml master-config.yaml.prepatch
$ oc ex config patch master-config.yaml.prepatch -p "$(cat master-config.patch)" > master-config.yaml
$ master-restart api
$ master-restart controllers
```

[[updating-node-configuration]]
== Updating the node configuration

To run the Elasticsearch application, you must make a change to the kernel configuration on each node.  This change is handled through the `sysctl` service.

Make the following changes on each node within your {product-title} 3.11 installation:

. Create a file named `/etc/sysctl.d/99-elasticsearch.conf` with the following contents:
+
`vm.max_map_count = 262144`
+
. Execute the following command:
+
```
$ sysctl vm.max_map_count=262144
```
