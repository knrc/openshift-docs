[[accessing-kiali-console]]
== Accessing the Kiali console

. A route to access the Kiali console already exists. Run the following command to obtain the route and Kiali URL:
+
```
$ oc get routes
```
+
While your exact environment may be different, you should see a result that's something like this:
+
```
